To stop and start the firewall using `firewalld`, you can use the following commands:

### **Stop `firewalld` Service**
Stopping the firewall will disable it, which could expose your server to security risks. Use this only for troubleshooting purposes and ensure you have alternative protection measures in place.

```bash
sudo systemctl stop firewalld
```

### **Start `firewalld` Service**
To start the firewall again after stopping it:

```bash
sudo systemctl start firewalld
```

### **Check Firewall Status**
To verify that `firewalld` is running:

```bash
sudo systemctl status firewalld
```

### **Restart `firewalld` Service**
To restart the firewall:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart firewalld
```

### **Verify Firewall Rules**
After restarting, ensure your firewall rules are correctly set:

```bash
sudo firewall-cmd --list-all
```

### **Additional Commands**
- **Enable `firewalld` to start on boot**:
  ```bash
  sudo systemctl enable firewalld
  ```

- **Disable `firewalld` from starting on boot**:
  ```bash
  sudo systemctl disable firewalld
  ```

Stopping the firewall temporarily can help determine if it is causing connectivity issues. However, be sure to re-enable and configure it properly to maintain the security of your server.

If you are still having issues accessing phpMyAdmin from outside your network, and the firewall isnâ€™t the problem, you may need to check other aspects of your server configuration or network settings.
